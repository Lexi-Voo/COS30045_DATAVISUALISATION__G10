# COS30045 - G10 Drug Testing Visualisation Project

## Overview

This project is an **interactive D3.js data visualisation dashboard** that explores drug‑testing patterns in Australia from **2008 to 2024**. It was developed as part of an academic assignment and aims to present insights from publicly available datasets in a clear, engaging, and ethical manner.

The dashboard is divided into multiple pages, each focusing on a specific research question (RQ). The site is built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js**. All data has been cleaned and preprocessed in KNIME and exported prior to allow more comprehensive visualisations plotting.

## Research Questions

### **RQ1 – Trends Over Time**

How have total drug tests and positive detections changed from 2008–2024?

* Visualised on **Page 1 (Home)**
* Includes interactive charts showing increases/decreases over time.

### **RQ2 – Most Common Drug Types**

Which drug types are most frequently detected?

* Visualised on **Page 2 (Drug Testing Patterns)**

### **RQ3 – Demographics Analysis**

How do drug detections vary by age group, gender, or other demographic categories?

* Page 2 visuals.

### **RQ4 – Location Type Prevalence**

Which locations (urban/rural/regional) show higher testing activity?

* Page 2 visuals.

### **RQ5 – Jurisdiction Comparison**

Which states/territories conduct more tests per 10,000 licences?

* Visualised on **Page 3 (Jurisdiction Comparison)**

## AI Declaration
* Some components of this project were developed with assistance from AI tools (ChatGPT), including help with debugging, explaining coding concepts, generating boilerplate code structures, and improving written clarity. All data analysis, visualisation design decisions, and final implementation were completed by the project authors.
